= 2 Getting In and Out of gdb
:toc: left

* This chapter discusses how to start gdb, and how to get out of it.
* The essentials are:
** type \'``gdb``' to start gdb.
** type `_quit_`, `_exit_` or `_Ctrl-d_` to exit.

== 2.1 Invoking gdb

* Invoke gdb by running the program `gdb`.
* Once started, gdb reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to
  exit.

'''

* You can also run `gdb` with a variety of arguments and options, to specify
  more of your debugging environment at the outset.

'''

* The command-line options described here are designed to cover a variety of
  situations; in some environments, some of these options may effectively be
  unavailable.

'''

* The most usual way to start gdb is with one argument, specifying an
  executable program:

[subs="quotes"]
....
gdb _program_
....

* You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
  specified:

[subs="quotes"]
....
gdb _program_ _core_
....

'''

* You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or use option
  `-p`, if you want to debug a running process:
+
[subs="quotes"]
....
gdb _program_ 1234
gdb -p 1234
....
+
would attach gdb to process `1234`.
* With option `-p` you can omit the _program_ filename.

'''

* Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly
  complete operating system; when you use gdb as a remote debugger attached to
  a bare board, there may not be any notion of "process", and there is often
  no way to get a core dump.
* gdb will warn you if it is unable to attach or to read core dumps.

'''

* You can optionally have `gdb` pass any arguments after the executable file
  to the inferior using `--args`.
* This option stops option processing.

....
gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c
....

'''

* This will cause `gdb` to debug `gcc`, and to set ``gcc``'s command-line
  arguments (see Section 4.3 [Arguments], page 38) to \'``-O2 -c foo.c``'.

'''

* You can run `gdb` without printing the front material, which describes gdb's
  non-warranty, by specifying `--silent` (or `-q`/`--quiet`):

....
gdb --silent
....

* You can further control how gdb starts up by using command-line options.
* gdb itself can remind you of the options available.
* Type
+
....
gdb -help
....
+
* to display all available options and briefly describe their use (\'``gdb
  -h``' is a shorter equivalent).

'''

* All options and command line arguments you give are processed in sequential
  order.
* The order makes a difference when the \'``-x``' option is used.
