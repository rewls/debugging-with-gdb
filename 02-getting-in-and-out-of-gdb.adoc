= 2 Getting In and Out of gdb
:toc: left

* This chapter discusses how to start gdb, and how to get out of it.
* The essentials are:
** type \'``gdb``' to start gdb.
** type `_quit_`, `_exit_` or `_Ctrl-d_` to exit.

== 2.1 Invoking gdb

* Invoke gdb by running the program `gdb`.
* Once started, gdb reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to
  exit.

'''

* You can also run `gdb` with a variety of arguments and options, to specify
  more of your debugging environment at the outset.

'''

* The command-line options described here are designed to cover a variety of
  situations; in some environments, some of these options may effectively be
  unavailable.

'''

* The most usual way to start gdb is with one argument, specifying an
  executable program:

[subs="quotes"]
....
gdb _program_
....

* You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
  specified:

[subs="quotes"]
....
gdb _program_ _core_
....

'''

* You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or use option
  `-p`, if you want to debug a running process:
+
[subs="quotes"]
....
gdb _program_ 1234
gdb -p 1234
....
+
would attach gdb to process `1234`.
* With option `-p` you can omit the _program_ filename.

'''

* Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly
  complete operating system; when you use gdb as a remote debugger attached to
  a bare board, there may not be any notion of "process", and there is often
  no way to get a core dump.
* gdb will warn you if it is unable to attach or to read core dumps.

'''

* You can optionally have `gdb` pass any arguments after the executable file
  to the inferior using `--args`.
* This option stops option processing.

....
gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c
....

'''

* This will cause `gdb` to debug `gcc`, and to set ``gcc``'s command-line
  arguments (see Section 4.3 [Arguments], page 38) to \'``-O2 -c foo.c``'.

'''

* You can run `gdb` without printing the front material, which describes gdb's
  non-warranty, by specifying `--silent` (or `-q`/`--quiet`):

....
gdb --silent
....

* You can further control how gdb starts up by using command-line options.
* gdb itself can remind you of the options available.
* Type
+
....
gdb -help
....
+
* to display all available options and briefly describe their use (\'``gdb
  -h``' is a shorter equivalent).

'''

* All options and command line arguments you give are processed in sequential
  order.
* The order makes a difference when the \'``-x``' option is used.

== 2.2 Quitting gdb

`quit [_expression_]`::
`exit [_expression_]`::
`q`::
* To exit gdb, use the `quit` command (abbreviated `q`), the `exit` command,
  or type an end-of-file character (usually `_Ctrl-d_`).
* If you do not supply expression, gdb will terminate normally; otherwise it
  will terminate using the result of expression as the error code.

'''

* An interrupt (often `_Ctrl-c_`) does not exit from gdb, but rather
  terminates the action of any gdb command that is in progress and returns to
  gdb command level.
* It is safe to type the interrupt character at any time because gdb does not
  allow it to take effect until a time when it is safe.

'''

* If you have been using gdb to control an attached process or device, you can
  release it with the `detach` command (see Section 4.7 [Debugging an
  Already-running Process], page 41).

== 2.3 Shell Commands

* If you need to execute occasional shell commands during your debugging
  session, there is no need to leave or suspend gdb; you can just use the
  `shell` command.

'''

`shell _command-string_`::
`!_command-string_`::
* Invoke a shell to execute _command-string_.
* Note that no space is needed between `!` and _command-string_.
* On GNU and Unix systems, the environment variable `SHELL`, if it exists,
  determines which shell to run.
* Otherwise gdb uses the default shell (`/bin/sh` on GNU and Unix systems,
  `cmd.exe` on MS-Windows, `COMMAND.COM` on MS-DOS, etc.).

'''

* You may also invoke shell commands from expressions, using the `$_shell`
  convenience function.
* See [$_shell convenience function], page 176.

'''

* The utility `make` is often needed in development environments.
* You do not have to use the `shell` command for this purpose in gdb:

'''

`make _make-args_`::
* Execute the `make` program with the specified arguments.
* This is equivalent to \'``shell make _make-args_``'.

`pipe [_command_] | _shell_command_`::
`| [_command_] | _shell_command_`::
`pipe -d _delim_ _command_ _delim_ _shell_command_`::
`| -d _delim_ _command_ _delim_ _shell_command_`::
* Executes _command_ and sends its output to _shell_command_.
* Note that no space is needed around `|`.
* If no _command_ is provided, the last _command_ executed is repeated.
+
'''
* In case the _command_ contains a `|`, the option `-d _delim_` can be used to
  specify an alternate delimiter string _delim_ that separates the command
  from the _shell_command_.
+
'''
* Example:
+
....
(gdb) p var
$1 = {
  black = 144,
  red = 233,
  green = 377,
  blue = 610,
  white = 987
}
(gdb) pipe p var|wc
      7      19      80
(gdb) |p var|wc -l
7
(gdb) p /x var
$4 = {
  black = 0x90,
  red = 0xe9,
  green = 0x179,
  blue = 0x262,
  white = 0x3db
}
(gdb) ||grep red
  red => 0xe9,
(gdb) | -d ! echo this contains a | char\n ! sed -e 's/|/PIPE/'
this contains a PIPE char
(gdb) | -d xxx echo this contains a | char!\n xxx sed -e 's/|/PIPE/'
this contains a PIPE char!
(gdb)
....

* The convenience variables `$_shell_exitcode` and `$_shell_exitsignal` can be
  used to examine the exit status of the last shell command launched by
  `shell`, `make`, `pipe` and `|`.
* See Section 10.12 [Convenience Variables], page 171.

== 2.4 Logging Output

* You may want to save the output of gdb commands to a file.
* There are several commands to control gdb's logging.

'''

`set logging enabled [on|off]`::
* Enable or disable logging.

`set logging file _file_`::
* Change the name of the current logfile.
* The default logfile is `gdb.txt`.

`set logging overwrite [on|off]`::
* By default, gdb will append to the logfile.
* Set `overwrite` if you want `set logging enabled on` to overwrite the
  logfile instead.

`set logging redirect [on|off]`::
* By default, gdb output will go to both the terminal and the logfile.
* Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

`set logging debugredirect [on|off]`;;
* By default, gdb debug output will go to both the terminal and the logfile.
* Set `debugredirect` if you want debug output to go only to the log file.

`show logging`::
* Show the current values of the logging settings.
* You can also redirect the output of a gdb command to a shell command.
* See [pipe], page 20.
