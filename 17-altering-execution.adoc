= 17 Altering Execution
:toc: left

* Once you think you have found an error in your program, you might want to
  find out for certain whether correcting the apparent error would lead to
  correct results in the rest of the run.
* You can find the answer by experiment, using the gdb features for altering
  execution of the program.

'''

* For example, you can store new values into variables or memory locations,
  give your program a signal, restart it at a different address, or even
  return prematurely from a function.

== 17.3 Giving your Program a Signal

`signal _signal_`::
* Resume execution where your program is stopped, but immediately give it the
  signal _signal_.
* The _signal_ can be the name or the number of a signal.
* For example, on many systems `signal 2` and `signal SIGINT` are both ways of
  sending an interrupt signal.
+
'''
* Alternatively, if _signal_ is zero, continue execution without giving a
  signal.
* This is useful when your program stopped on account of a signal and would
  ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the `continue` command;
  \'``signal 0``' causes it to resume without a signal.
+
'''
* _Note_: When resuming a multi-threaded program, _signal_ is delivered to the
  currently selected thread, not the thread that last reported a stop.
* This includes the situation where a thread was stopped due to a signal.
* So if you want to continue execution suppressing the signal that stopped a
  thread, you should select that same thread before issuing the \'``signal
  0``' command.
* If you issue the \'``signal 0``' command with another thread as the selected
  one, gdb detects that and asks for confirmation.
+
'''
* Invoking the `signal` command is not the same as invoking the `kill` utility
  from the shell.
* Sending a signal with `kill` causes gdb to decide what to do with the signal
  depending on the signal handling tables (see Section 5.4 [Signals], page
  89).
* The `signal` command passes the signal directly to your program.
+
'''
* `signal` does not repeat when you press `RET` a second time after executing
  the command.

`queue-signal _signal_`::
* Queue _signal_ to be delivered immediately to the current thread when
  execution of the thread resumes.
* The _signal_ can be the name or the number of a signal.
* For example, on many systems `signal 2` and `signal SIGINT` are both ways of
  sending an interrupt signal.
* The handling of the signal must be set to pass the signal to the program,
  otherwise gdb will report an error.
* You can control the handling of signals from gdb with the `handle` command
  (see Section 5.4 [Signals], page 89).
+
'''
* Alternatively, if _signal_ is zero, any currently queued signal for the
  current thread is discarded and when execution resumes no signal will be
  delivered.
* This is useful when your program stopped on account of a signal and would
  ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the `continue` command.
+
'''
* This command differs from the `signal` command in that the signal is just
  queued, execution is not resumed.
* And `queue-signal` cannot be used to pass a signal whose handling state has
  been set to `nopass` (see Section 5.4 [Signals], page 89).

'''

* See [stepping into signal handlers], page 91, for information on how
  stepping commands behave when the thread has a signal queued.
