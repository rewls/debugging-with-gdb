= 3 gdb Commands
:toc: left

* You can abbreviate a gdb command to the first few letters of the command
  name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous; and you can repeat certain gdb
  commands by typing just `RET`.
* You can also use the `TAB` key to get gdb to fill out the rest of a word in
  a command (or to show you the alternatives available, if there is more than
  one possibility).

== 3.1 Command Syntax

* A gdb command is a single line of input.
* There is no limit on how long it can be.
* It starts with a command name, which is followed by arguments whose meaning depends on the command name.
* For example, the command step accepts an argument which is the number of
  times to step, as in \'``step 5``'.
* You can also use the `step` command with no arguments.
* Some commands do not allow any arguments.

'''

* gdb command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is
  unambiguous.
* Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the documentation for
  individual commands.
* In some cases, even ambiguous abbreviations are allowed; for example, `s` is
  specially defined as equivalent to `step` even though there are other
  commands whose names start with `s`.
* You can test abbreviations by using them as arguments to the `help` command.

'''

* A blank line as input to gdb (typing just `RET`) means to repeat the
  previous command.
* Certain commands (for example, `run`) will not repeat this way; these are
  commands whose unintentional repetition might cause trouble and which you
  are unlikely to want to repeat.
* User-defined commands can disable this feature; see Section 23.1.1 [Define],
  page 391.

'''

* The `list` and `x commands, when you repeat them with `RET`, construct new
  arguments rather than repeating exactly as typed.
* This permits easy scanning of source or memory.

'''

* gdb can also use `RET` in another way: to partition lengthy output, in a way
  similar to the common utility `more` (see Section 22.4 [Screen Size], page
  370).
* Since it is easy to press one RET too many in this situation, gdb disables
  command repetition after any command that generates this sort of display.

'''

* Any text from a `#` to the end of the line is a comment; it does nothing.
* This is useful mainly in command files (see Section 23.1.3 [Command Files],
  page 395).

'''

* The `Ctrl-o` binding is useful for repeating a complex sequence of commands.
* This command accepts the current line, like `RET`, and then fetches the next
  line relative to the current line from the history for editing.
