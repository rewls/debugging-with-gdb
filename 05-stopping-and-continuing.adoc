= 5 Stopping and Continuing
:toc: left

* The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your
  program before it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into trouble,
  you can investigate and find out why.

'''

* Inside gdb, your program may stop for any of several reasons, such as a
  signal, a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a gdb command such as
  `step`.
* You may then examine and change variables, set new breakpoints or remove old
  ones, and then continue execution.
* Usually, the messages shown by gdb provide ample explanation of the status
  of your program -- but you can also explicitly request this information at
  any time.

'''

`info program`::
* Display information about the status of your program: whether it is running
  or not, what process it is, and why it stopped.

== 5.1 Breakpoints, Watchpoints, and Catchpoints

* A _breakpoint_ makes your program stop whenever a certain point in the
  program is reached.
* For each breakpoint, you can add conditions to control in finer detail
  whether your program stops.
* You can set breakpoints with the `break` command and its variants (see
  Section 5.1.1 [Setting Breakpoints], page 58), to specify the place where
  your program should stop by line number, function name or exact address in
  the program.

'''

* On some systems, you can set breakpoints in shared libraries before the
  executable is run.

'''

* A _watchpoint_ is a special breakpoint that stops your program when the
  value of an expression changes.
* The expression may be a value of a variable, or it could involve values of
  one or more variables combined by operators, such as \'``a + b``'.
* This is sometimes called _data breakpoints_.
* You must use a different command to set watchpoints (see Section 5.1.2
  [Setting Watchpoints], page 66), but aside from that, you can manage a
  watchpoint like any other breakpoint: you enable, disable, and delete both
  breakpoints and watchpoints using the same commands.

'''

* You can arrange to have values from your program displayed automatically
  whenever gdb stops at a breakpoint.
* See Section 10.8 [Automatic Display], page 155.

'''

* A _catchpoint_ is another special breakpoint that stops your program when a
  certain kind of event occurs, such as the throwing of a C++ exception or the
  loading of a library.
* As with watchpoints, you use a different command to set a catchpoint (see
  Section 5.1.3 [Setting Catchpoints], page 69), but aside from that, you can
  manage a catchpoint like any other breakpoint.
* (To stop when your program receives a signal, use the `handle` command; see
  Section 5.4 [Signals], page 89.)

'''

* gdb assigns a number to each breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint when you
  create it; these numbers are successive integers starting with one.
* In many of the commands for controlling various features of breakpoints you
  use the breakpoint number to say which breakpoint you want to change.
* Each breakpoint may be enabled or disabled; if disabled, it has no effect on
  your program until you enable it again.

'''

* Some gdb commands accept a space-separated list of breakpoints on which to
  operate.
* A list element can be either a single breakpoint number, like \'``5``', or a
  range of such numbers, like \'``5-7``'.
* When a breakpoint list is given to a command, all breakpoints in that list
  are operated on.
