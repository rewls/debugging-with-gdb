= 4 Running Programs Under gdb

* When you run a program under gdb, you must first generate debugging
  information when you compile it.

'''

* You may start gdb with its arguments, if any, in an environment of your
  choice.
* If you are doing native debugging, you may redirect your program's input and
  output, debug an already running process, or kill a child process.

== 4.1 Compiling for Debugging

* In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate debugging
  information when you compile it.
* This debugging information is stored in the object file; it describes the
  data type of each variable or function and the correspondence between source
  line numbers and addresses in the executable code.

'''

* To request debugging information, specify the \'``-g``' option when you run
  the compiler.

'''

* Programs that are to be shipped to your customers are compiled with
  optimizations, using the \'``-O``' compiler option.
* However, some compilers are unable to handle the \'``-g``' and \'``-O``'
  options together.
* Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized executables containing
  debugging information.

'''

* gcc, the gnu C/C++ compiler, supports \'``-g``' with or without \'``-O``',
  making it possible to debug optimized code.
* We recommend that you always use \'``-g``' whenever you compile a program.
* You may think your program is correct, but there is no sense in pushing your luck.
* For more information, see Chapter 11 [Optimized Code], page 195.

'''

* Older versions of the gnu C compiler permitted a variant option \'``-gg``'
  for debugging information.
* gdb no longer supports this format; if your gnu C compiler has this option,
  do not use it.

'''

* gdb knows about preprocessor macros and can show you their expansion (see
  Chapter 12 [Macros], page 199).
* Most compilers do not include information about preprocessor macros in the
  debugging information if you specify the `-g` flag alone.
* Version 3.1 and later of gcc, the gnu C compiler, provides macro information
  if you are using the DWARF debugging format, and specify the option `-g3`.

'''

* See Section "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC" in Using the gnu
  Compiler Collection (GCC), for more information on gcc options affecting
  debug information.

'''

* You will have the best debugging experience if you use the latest version of
  the DWARF debugging format that your compiler supports.
* DWARF is currently the most expressive and best supported debugging format
  in gdb.

== 4.2 Starting your Program

`run`::
`r`::
* Use the `run` command to start your program under gdb.
* You must first specify the program name with an argument to gdb (see Chapter
  2 [Getting In and Out of gdb], page 11), or by using the i`file` or
  `exec-file` command (see Section 18.1 [Commands to Specify Files], page
  291).

'''

* If you are running your program in an execution environment that supports
  processes, `run` creates an inferior process and makes that process run your
  program.
* In some environments without processes, `run` jumps to the start of your
  program.
* Other targets, like \'``remote``', are always running.
* If you get an error message like this one:
+
....
The "remote" target does not support "run".
Try "help target" or "continue".
....
+
then use `continue` to run your program.
* You may need `load` first (see [load], page 313).

'''

* The execution of a program is affected by certain information it receives
  from its superior.
* gdb provides ways to specify this information, which you must do before
  starting your program.
* (You can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect
  your program the next time you start it.)
* This information may be divided into four categories:

'''

The _arguments_.::
* Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the `run`
  command.
* If a shell is available on your target, the shell is used to pass the
  arguments, so that you may use normal conventions (such as wildcard
  expansion or variable substitution) in describing the arguments.
* In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the `SHELL`
  environment variable.
* If you do not define `SHELL`, gdb uses the default shell (`/bin/sh`).
* You can disable use of any shell with the `set startup-with-shell` command
  (see below for details).

The _environment_.::
* Your program normally inherits its environment from gdb, but you can use the
  gdb commands `set environment` and `unset environment` to change parts of
  the environment that affect your program.
* See Section 4.4 [Your Program's Environment], page 38.

The _working directory_.::
* You can set your program's working directory with the command `set cwd`.
* If you do not set any working directory with this command, your program will
  inherit gdb's working directory if native debugging, or the remote server's
  working directory if remote debugging.
* See Section 4.5 [Your Program's Working Directory], page 39.

The _standard input and output_.::
* Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and standard
  output as gdb is using.
* You can redirect input and output in the `run` command line, or you can use
  the `tty` command to set a different device for your program.
* See Section 4.6 [Your Program's Input and Output], page 40.
+
[WARNING]
====
* While input and output redirection work, you cannot use pipes to pass the
  output of the program you are debugging to another program; if you attempt
  this, gdb is likely to wind up debugging the wrong program.
====

* When you issue the `run` command, your program begins to execute
  immediately.
* See Chapter 5 [Stopping and Continuing], page 57, for discussion of how to
  arrange for your program to stop.
* Once your program has stopped, you may call functions in your program, using
  the `print` or `call` commands.
* See Chapter 10 [Examining Data], page 141.

'''

* If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last time
  gdb read its symbols, gdb discards its symbol table, and reads it again.
* When it does this, gdb tries to retain your current breakpoints.

== 4.9 Debugging Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs

* gdb lets you run and debug multiple programs in a single session.
* In addition, gdb on some systems may let you run several programs
  simultaneously (otherwise you have to exit from one before starting
  another).
* On some systems gdb may even let you debug several programs simultaneously
  on different remote systems.
* In the most general case, you can have multiple threads of execution in each
  of multiple processes, launched from multiple executables, running on
  different machines.

'''

* gdb represents the state of each program execution with an object called an
  _inferior_.
* An inferior typically corresponds to a process, but is more general and
  applies also to targets that do not have processes.
* Inferiors may be created before a process runs, and may be retained after a
  process exits.
* Inferiors have unique identifiers that are different from process ids.
* Usually each inferior will also have its own distinct address space,
  although some embedded targets may have several inferiors running in
  different parts of a single address space.
* Each inferior may in turn have multiple threads running in it.

'''

* The commands `info inferiors` and `info connections`, which will be
  introduced below, accept a space-separated _ID list_ as their argument
  specifying one or more elements on which to operate.
* A list element can be either a single non-negative number, like \'``5``', or
  an ascending range of such numbers, like \'``5-7``'.
* A list can consist of any combination of such elements, even duplicates or
  overlapping ranges are valid.
* E.g. \'``1 4-6 5 4-4``' or \'``1 2 4-7``'.

'''

* To find out what inferiors exist at any moment, use `info inferiors`:

'''

`info inferiors`::
* Print a list of all inferiors currently being managed by gdb.
* By default all inferiors are printed, but the ID list _id_... can be used to
  limit the display to just the requested inferiors.
+
'''
* gdb displays for each inferior (in this order):
1. the inferior number assigned by gdb
2. the target system's inferior identifier
3. the target connection the inferior is bound to, including the unique
   connection number assigned by gdb, and the protocol used by the connection.
4. the name of the executable the inferior is running.
+
'''
* An asterisk \'``*``' preceding the gdb inferior number indicates the current
  inferior.
+
'''
* For example,
+
....
(gdb) info inferiors
  Num	Description	Connection			Executable
* 1	process 3401	1 (native)			goodbye
  2	process 2307	2 (extended-remote host:10000)	hello
....

'''

* To get information about the current inferior, use `inferior`:

'''

`inferior`::
* Shows information about the current inferior.
* For example,
+
....
(gdb) inferior
[Current inferior is 1 [process 3401] (helloworld)]
....

'''

* To find out what open target connections exist at any moment, use `info
  connections`:

'''

`info connections`::
* Print a list of all open target connections currently being managed by gdb.
* By default all connections are printed, but the ID list _id_... can be used
  to limit the display to just the requested connections.
* gdb displays for each connection (in this order):
1. the connection number assigned by gdb.
2. the protocol used by the connection.
3. a textual description of the protocol used by the connection.
+
'''
* An asterisk \'``*``' preceding the connection number indicates the
  connection of the current inferior.
* For example,
+
....
(gdb) info connections
  Num	What				Description
* 1	extended-remote host:10000	Extended remote serial target in gdb-specific protocol
  2	native				Native process
  3	core				Local core dump file
....

'''

* To switch focus between inferiors, use the `inferior` command:

'''

`inferior _infno_`::
* Make inferior number _infno_ the current inferior.
* The argument _infno_ is the inferior number assigned by gdb, as shown in the
  first field of the \'``info inferiors``' display.

'''

* The debugger convenience variable \'``$_inferior``' contains the number of
  the current inferior.
* You may find this useful in writing breakpoint conditional expressions,
  command scripts, and so forth.
* See Section 10.12 [Convenience Variables], page 171, for general information
  on convenience variables.

'''

* You can get multiple executables into a debugging session via the
  `add-inferior` and `clone-inferior` commands.
* On some systems gdb can add inferiors to the debug session automatically by
  following calls to `fork` and `exec`.
* To remove inferiors from the debugging session use the `remove-inferiors`
  command.

'''

`add-inferior [ -copies _n_ ] [ -exec _executable_ ] [-no-connection ]`::
* Adds _n_ inferiors to be run using _executable_ as the executable; _n_
  defaults to 1.
* If no _executable_ is specified, the inferiors begins empty, with no
  program.
* You can still assign or change the program assigned to the inferior at any
  time by using the `file` command with the executable name as its argument.
+
'''
* By default, the new inferior begins connected to the same target connection
  as the current inferior.
* For example, if the current inferior was connected to `gdbserver` with
  `target remote`, then the new inferior will be connected to the same
  `gdbserver` instance.
* The \'``-no-connection``' option starts the new inferior with no connection
  yet.
* You can then for example use the `target remote` command to connect to some
  other `gdbserver` instance, use `run` to spawn a local program, etc.

`clone-inferior [ -copies _n_ ] [ _infno_ ]`::
* Adds _n_ inferiors ready to execute the same program as inferior _infno_;
  _n_ defaults to 1, and _infno_ defaults to the number of the current
  inferior.
* This command copies the values of the _args_, _inferior-tty_ and _cwd_
  properties from the current inferior to the new one.
* It also propagates changes the user made to environment variables using the
  `set environment` and `unset environment` commands.
* This is a convenient command when you want to run another instance of the
  inferior you are debugging.
+
....
(gdb) info inferiors
  Num	Description	Connection	Executable
* 1	process 29964	1 (native)	helloworld
(gdb) clone-inferior
Added inferior 2.
1 inferiors added.
(gdb) info inferiors
  Num	Description	Connection	Executable
* 1	process 29964	1 (native)	helloworld
  2	<null>		1 (native)	helloworld
....

* You can now simply switch focus to inferior 2 and run it.

`remove-inferiors _infno_...`::
* Removes the inferior or inferiors _infno_....
* It is not possible to remove an inferior that is running with this command.
* For those, use the `kill` or `detach` command first.

'''

* To quit debugging one of the running inferiors that is not the current
  inferior, you can either `detach` from it by using the `detach inferior`
  command (allowing it to run independently), or `kill` it using the `kill
  inferiors` command:

'''

`detach inferior _infno_...`::
* Detach from the inferior or inferiors identified by gdb inferior number(s)
  _infno_....
* Note that the inferior's entry still stays on the list of inferiors shown by
  `info inferiors`, but its Description will show \'``<null>``'.

`kill inferiors _infno_...`::
* Kill the inferior or inferiors identified by gdb inferior number(s)
  _infno_....
* Note that the inferior's entry still stays on the list of inferiors shown by
  `info inferiors`, but its Description will show \'``<null>``'.

'''

* After the successful completion of a command such as `detach`, `detach
  inferiors`, `kill` or `kill inferiors`, or after a normal process exit, the
  inferior is still valid and listed with `info inferiors`, ready to be
  restarted.

'''

* Many commands will work the same with multiple programs as with a single
  program: e.g., `print myglobal` will simply display the value of `myglobal`
  in the current inferior.

'''

* Occasionally, when debugging gdb itself, it may be useful to get more info
  about the relationship of inferiors, programs, address spaces in a debug
  session.
* You can do that with the `maint info program-spaces` command.

'''

`maint info program-spaces`::
* Print a list of all program spaces currently being managed by gdb.
* gdb displays for each program space (in this order):
1. the program space number assigned by gdb
2. the name of the executable loaded into the program space, with e.g., the
   `file` command.
3. the name of the core file loaded into the program space, with e.g., the
   `core-file` command.
+
'''
* An asterisk \'``*``' preceding the gdb program space number indicates the
  current program space.
+
'''
* In addition, below each program space line, gdb prints extra information
  that isn't suitable to display in tabular form.
* For example, the list of inferiors bound to the program space.
+
....
(gdb) maint info program-spaces
  Id	Executable	Core File
* 1	hello
  2	goodbye
         Bound inferiors: ID 1 (process 21561)
....

* Here we can see that no inferior is running the program `hello`, while
  process 21561 is running the program `goodbye`.
* On some targets, it is possible that multiple inferiors are bound to the
  same program space.
* The most common example is that of debugging both the parent and child
  processes of a `vfork` call.
* For example,
+
....
(gdb) maint info program-spaces
  Id	Executable	Core File
* 1	vfork-test
         Bound inferiors: ID 2 (process 18050), ID 1 (process 18045)
....

* Here, both inferior 2 and inferior 1 are running in the same program space
  as a result of inferior 1 having executed a `vfork` call.

=== 4.9.1 Inferior-Specific Breakpoints

* When debugging multiple inferiors, you can choose whether to set breakpoints
  for all inferiors, or for a particular inferior.

'''

`break _locspec_ inferior _inferior-id_`::
`break _locspec_ inferior _inferior-id_ if ...`::
* _locspec_ specifies a code location or locations in your program.
* See Section 9.2 [Location Specifications], page 126, for details.
+
'''
* Use the qualifier \'``inferior _inferior-id``' with a breakpoint command to
  specify that you only want gdb to stop when a particular inferior reaches
  this breakpoint.
* The _inferior-id_ specifier is one of the inferior identifiers assigned by
  gdb, shown in the first column of the \'``info inferiors``' output.
+
'''
* If you do not specify \'``inferior _inferior-id_``' when you set a
  breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to all inferiors of your program.
* You can use the `inferior` qualifier on conditional breakpoints as well; in
  this case, place \'``inferior _inferior-id_``' before or after the
  breakpoint condition, like this:
+
....
(gdb) break frik.c:13 inferior 2 if bartab > lim
....

'''

* Inferior-specific breakpoints are automatically deleted when the
  corresponding inferior is removed from gdb.
* For example:
....
(gdb) remove-inferiors 2
Inferior-specific breakpoint 3 deleted - inferior 2 has been removed.
....

* A breakpoint can't be both inferior-specific and thread-specific (see
  Section 5.5.4 [Thread-Specific Breakpoints], page 96), or task-specific (see
  Section 15.4.10.7 [Ada Tasks], page 255); using more than one of the
  inferior, thread, or task keywords when creating a breakpoint will give an
  error.

== 4.12 Setting a Bookmark to Return to Later

* On certain operating systems{empty}footnote:[Currently, only gnu/Linux.],
  gdb is able to save a snapshot of a program's state, called a _checkpoint_,
  and come back to it later.

'''

* Returning to a checkpoint effectively undoes everything that has happened in
  the program since the checkpoint was saved.
* This includes changes in memory, registers, and even (within some limits)
  system state.
* Effectively, it is like going back in time to the moment when the checkpoint
  was saved.

'''

* Thus, if you're stepping through a program and you think you're getting
  close to the point where things go wrong, you can save a checkpoint.
* Then, if you accidentally go too far and miss the critical statement,
  instead of having to restart your program from the beginning, you can just
  go back to the checkpoint and start again from there.

* This can be especially useful if it takes a lot of time or steps to reach
  the point where you think the bug occurs.

'''

* To use the `checkpoint/restart` method of debugging:

'''

`checkpoint`::
* Save a snapshot of the debugged program's current execution state.
* The `checkpoint` command takes no arguments, but each checkpoint is assigned
  a small integer id, similar to a breakpoint id.

`info checkpoints`::
* List the checkpoints that have been saved in the current debugging session.
* For each checkpoint, the following information will be listed:
+
....
Checkpoint ID
Process ID
Code Address
Source line, or label
....

`restart _checkpoint-id_`::
* Restore the program state that was saved as checkpoint number
  _checkpoint-id_.
* All program variables, registers, stack frames etc. will be returned to the
  values that they had when the checkpoint was saved.
* In essence, gdb will "wind back the clock" to the point in time when the
  checkpoint was saved.
+
'''
* Note that breakpoints, gdb variables, command history etc. are not affected
  by restoring a checkpoint.
* In general, a checkpoint only restores things that reside in the program
  being debugged, not in the debugger.

`delete checkpoint _checkpoint-id_`
* Delete the previously-saved checkpoint identified by _checkpoint-id_.

'''

* Returning to a previously saved checkpoint will restore the user state of
  the program being debugged, plus a significant subset of the system (OS)
  state, including file pointers.
* It won't "un-write" data from a file, but it will rewind the file pointer to
  the previous location, so that the previously written data can be
  overwritten.
* For files opened in read mode, the pointer will also be restored so that the
  previously read data can be read again.

'''

* Of course, characters that have been sent to a printer (or other external
  device) cannot be "snatched back", and characters received from eg. a serial
  device can be removed from internal program buffers, but they cannot be
  "pushed back" into the serial pipeline, ready to be received again.
* Similarly, the actual contents of files that have been changed cannot be
  restored (at this time).

'''

* However, within those constraints, you actually can "rewind" your program to
  a previously saved point in time, and begin debugging it again -- and you can
  change the course of events so as to debug a different execution path this
  time.

'''

* Finally, there is one bit of internal program state that will be different
  when you return to a checkpoint -- the program's process id.
* Each checkpoint will have a unique process id (or _pid_), and each will be
  different from the program's original _pid_.
* If your program has saved a local copy of its process id, this could
  potentially pose a problem.

=== 4.12.1 A Non-obvious Benefit of Using Checkpoints

* On some systems such as gnu/Linux, address space randomization is performed
  on new processes for security reasons.
* This makes it difficult or impossible to set a breakpoint, or watchpoint, on
  an absolute address if you have to restart the program, since the absolute
  location of a symbol will change from one execution to the next.

'''

* A checkpoint, however, is an identical copy of a process.
* Therefore if you create a checkpoint at (eg.) the start of main, and simply
  return to that checkpoint instead of restarting the process, you can avoid
  the effects of address randomization and your symbols will all stay in the
  same place.
