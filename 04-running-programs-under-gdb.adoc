= 4 Running Programs Under gdb

* When you run a program under gdb, you must first generate debugging
  information when you compile it.

'''

* You may start gdb with its arguments, if any, in an environment of your
  choice.
* If you are doing native debugging, you may redirect your program's input and
  output, debug an already running process, or kill a child process.

== 4.1 Compiling for Debugging

* In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate debugging
  information when you compile it.
* This debugging information is stored in the object file; it describes the
  data type of each variable or function and the correspondence between source
  line numbers and addresses in the executable code.

'''

* To request debugging information, specify the \'``-g``' option when you run
  the compiler.

'''

* Programs that are to be shipped to your customers are compiled with
  optimizations, using the \'``-O``' compiler option.
* However, some compilers are unable to handle the \'``-g``' and \'``-O``'
  options together.
* Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized executables containing
  debugging information.

'''

* gcc, the gnu C/C++ compiler, supports \'``-g``' with or without \'``-O``',
  making it possible to debug optimized code.
* We recommend that you always use \'``-g``' whenever you compile a program.
* You may think your program is correct, but there is no sense in pushing your luck.
* For more information, see Chapter 11 [Optimized Code], page 195.

'''

* Older versions of the gnu C compiler permitted a variant option \'``-gg``'
  for debugging information.
* gdb no longer supports this format; if your gnu C compiler has this option,
  do not use it.

'''

* gdb knows about preprocessor macros and can show you their expansion (see
  Chapter 12 [Macros], page 199).
* Most compilers do not include information about preprocessor macros in the
  debugging information if you specify the `-g` flag alone.
* Version 3.1 and later of gcc, the gnu C compiler, provides macro information
  if you are using the DWARF debugging format, and specify the option `-g3`.

'''

* See Section "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC" in Using the gnu
  Compiler Collection (GCC), for more information on gcc options affecting
  debug information.

'''

* You will have the best debugging experience if you use the latest version of
  the DWARF debugging format that your compiler supports.
* DWARF is currently the most expressive and best supported debugging format
  in gdb.
