= 1 A Sample gdb Session

* You can use this manual at your leisure to read all about gdb.
* However, a handful of commands are enough to get started using the debugger.
* This chapter illustrates those commands.

'''

* In this sample session, we emphasize user input like this: *input*, to make it
  easier to pick out from the surrounding output.

'''

* One of the preliminary versions of gnu `m4` (a generic macro processor)
  exhibits the following bug: sometimes, when we change its quote strings from
  the default, the commands used to capture one macro definition within
  another stop working.
* In the following short `m4` session, we define a macro `foo` which expands
  to `0000`; we then use the `m4` built-in `defn` to define `bar` as the same
  thing.
* However, when we change the open quote string to `<QUOTE>` and the close
  quote string to `<UNQUOTE>`, the same procedure fails to define a new
  synonym `baz`:

[subs="quotes"]
....
$ *cd gnu/m4*
$ *./m4*
*define(foo,0000)*

*foo*
0000
*define(bar,defn('foo'))*

*bar*
0000
*changequote(&lt;QUOTE>,&lt;UNQUOTE>)*

*define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE>foo&lt;UNQUOTE>))*
*baz*
*Ctrl-d*
m4: End of input: 0: fatal error: EOF in string
....

* Let us use gdb to try to see what is going on.

[subs="quotes"]
....
$ *gdb m4*

* gdb reads only enough symbol data to know where to find the rest when
  needed; as a result, the first prompt comes up very quickly.
* We now tell gdb to use a narrower display width than usual, so that examples
  fit in this manual.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *set width 70*
....

* We need to see how the `m4` built-in `changequote` works.
* Having looked at the source, we know the relevant subroutine is
  `m4_changequote`, so we set a breakpoint there with the gdb `break` command.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *break m4_changequote*
Breakpoint 1 at 0x62f4: file builtin.c, line 879.
....

* Using the `run` command, we start `m4` running under `gdb` control; as long
  as control does not reach the `m4_changequote` subroutine, the program runs
  as usual:

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *run*
Starting program: /work/Editorial/gdb/gnu/m4/m4
*define(foo,0000)*

*foo*
0000
....

* To trigger the breakpoint, we call `changequote`.
* gdb suspends execution of `m4`, displaying information about the context
  where it stops.

[subs="quotes"]
....
*changequote(&lt;QUOTE>,&lt;UNQUOTE>)*

Breakpoint 1, m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
    at builtin.c:879
879         if (bad_argc(TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[0]),argc,1,3))
....

* Now we use the command `n` (`next`) to advance execution to the next line of
  the current function.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *n*
882         set_quotes((argc >= 2) ? TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[1])\
 : nil,
....

* `set_quotes` looks like a promising subroutine.
* We can go into it by using the command `s` (`step`) instead of `next`.
* `step` goes to the next line to be executed in _any_ subroutine, so it steps
  into `set_quotes`.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *s*
set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;QUOTE>", rq=0x34c88 "&lt;UNQUOTE>")
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
....

* The display that shows the subroutine where `m4` is now suspended (and its
  arguments) is called a stack frame display.
* It shows a summary of the stack.
* We can use the `backtrace` command (which can also be spelled `bt`), to see
  where we are in the stack as a whole: the `backtrace` command displays a stack
  frame for each active subroutine.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *bt*
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;QUOTE>", rq=0x34c88 "&lt;UNQUOTE>")
    at input.c:530

#5  0x2930 in main (argc=0, argv=0xf7fffb20) at m4.c:195
....

* We step through a few more lines to see what happens.
* The first two times, we can use \'``s``'; the next two times we use `n` to
  avoid falling into the `xstrdup` subroutine.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *s*
0x3b5c 532         if (rquote != def_rquote)
(gdb) *s*
0x3b80 535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == ’\0’) ? \
def_lquote : xstrdup(lq);
(gdb) *n*
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == ’\0’) ? def_rquote\
: xstrdup(rq);
(gdb) *n*
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
....

* The last line displayed looks a little odd; we can examine the variables
  `lquote` and `rquote` to see if they are in fact the new left and right
   quotes we specified.
* We use the command `p` (`print`) to see their values.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *p lquote*
$1 = 0x35d40 "<QUOTE>"
(gdb) *p rquote*
$2 = 0x35d50 "<UNQUOTE>"
....

* `lquote` and `rquote` are indeed the new left and right quotes.
* To look at some context, we can display ten lines of source surrounding the
  current line with the `l` (`list`) command.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *l*
533            xfree(rquote);
534
535        lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == ’\0’) ? def_lquote\
: xstrdup (lq);
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == ’\0’) ? def_rquote\
: xstrdup (rq);
537
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
540     }
541
542     void
....

* Let us step past the two lines that set len_lquote and len_rquote, and then
  examine the values of those variables.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *n*
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
(gdb) *n*
540     }
(gdb) *p len_lquote*
$3 = 9
(gdb) *p len_rquote*
$4 = 7
....

* That certainly looks wrong, assuming `len_lquote` and `len_rquote` are meant
  to be the lengths of `lquote` and `rquote` respectively.
* We can set them to better values using the `p` command, since it can print
  the value of any expression -- and that expression can include subroutine
  calls and assignments.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *p len lquote=strlen(lquote)*
$5 = 7
(gdb) *p len rquote=strlen(rquote)*
$6 = 9
....

* Is that enough to fix the problem of using the new quotes with the `m4`
  built-in `defn`?
* We can allow `m4` to continue executing with the `c` (`continue`) command,
  and then try the example that caused trouble initially:

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *c*
Continuing.

*define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE>foo&lt;UNQUOTE>))*

*baz*
0000
....

* Success!
* The new quotes now work just as well as the default ones.
* The problem seems to have been just the two typos defining the wrong
  lengths.
* We allow `m4` exit by giving it an EOF as input:

[subs="quotes"]
....
*Ctrl-d*
Program exited normally.
....

* The message \'``Program exited normally.``' is from gdb; it indicates `m4`
  has finished executing.
* We can end our gdb session with the gdb `quit` command.

[subs="quotes"]
....
(gdb) *quit*
....
